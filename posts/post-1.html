                        <p>Back in June was our wedding. As one would expect we took off on a honeymoon the next day. About a year before when we were planning the wedding and honeymoon, we stumbled upon some relatively cheap plane tickets to Narita airport outside Tokyo. We both thought a trip to Japan would be amazing, so we jumped at the opportunity and built our trip around the flights. We couldn’t have been happier with the outcome.</p>
                        <p>While I’ve traveled internationally many times thanks to my parents letting us kids tag along, this trip would be Vista’s first international trip and I wanted to make sure she enjoyed travel as much as I do. As you’ll see, this meant stopping for a lot of ice cream. Something Vista can’t resist.</p>
                        <p>Because we were trying to keep the cost of the trip down, we did a lot of low cost activities and walked as much as we could (although most of the walking ended up being a result of not being able to figure out how to use the bus system). This took us to some interesting places and overall we had a great time.</p>

                        </span>
                        <p>The last time Vista was on a plane she got sick and threw up. Luckily, this time Singapore Airlines supplied her with an ice cream sandwich, so she had no problems this time. The food on the plane was surprisingly good as well. I’ve only ever flown on Delta to my recollection and Singapore Airlines was far better in my opinion.</p>

                    We&apos;re Chris & Vista. Two Computer Science students with a love for travel and the great outdoors. After walking 10 miles a day on our honeymoon in Japan and biking the 38-mile Sella Ronda in the Dolomites a month later, we’re itching for our next adventure.
