            <p>Back in June was our wedding. As one would expect we took off on a honeymoon the next day. About a year before when we were planning the wedding and honeymoon, we stumbled upon some relatively cheap plane tickets to Narita airport outside Tokyo. We both thought a trip to Japan would be amazing, so we jumped at the opportunity and built our trip around the flights. We couldn’t have been happier with the outcome.</p>
            <p>While I’ve traveled internationally many times thanks to my parents letting us kids tag along, this trip would be Vista’s first international trip and I wanted to make sure she enjoyed travel as much as I do. As you’ll see, this meant stopping for a lot of ice cream. Something Vista can’t resist.</p>
            <p>Because we were trying to keep the cost of the trip down, we did a lot of low cost activities and walked as much as we could (although most of the walking ended up being a result of not being able to figure out how to use the bus system). This took us to some interesting places and overall we had a great time.</p>

            <p>The last time Vista was on a plane she got sick and threw up. Luckily, this time Singapore Airlines supplied her with an ice cream sandwich, so she had no problems this time. The food on the plane was surprisingly good as well. I’ve only ever flown on Delta to my recollection and Singapore Airlines was far better in my opinion.</p>

            <p>Our flight landed in Narita around 9:30PM and we still needed to pick up our pocket wifi and take the bus to Tokyo. All of this menat we were going to be getting to our Airbnb close to midnight on the second day of our trip. No biggie. We also saw this cool Airbus A380 on our way through Narita.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Thanks to the time difference between Utah and Tokyo the following morning we both woke up at 4AM and weren’t groggy at all. (4AM in Tokyo is 1PM in Utah) This would become a regular thing throughout our trip. We didn’t have any food yet, so we hopped up, snapped a picture of our Airbnb, and took off towards our first stop all the while looking for somewhere to get some food.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Our first stop was Senso-ji. Neither of us know anything about the history surrounding the temples that we visited on this trip and looking it up proved to be confusing without knowledge of Japan’s history. The temples and other architecture in Japan, however, spoke for itself. The Japanese have an eye for detail in everything they do and their architecture is no exception. Each temple was intricately decorated with figures and colors which I’m sure all have some symbolic meaning.</p>
            <p>Somehow we managed not to get a picture of the Senso-ji temple itself and instead took pictures of the rest of the buildings in the complex. This is likely due to us being concerned that taking a picture while people were praying at the temple would be considered disrespectful and we thus waited until we saw others taking pictures, which didn’t occur until we had moved on to other buildings in the complex.</p>
            <p>The good news is that on the way there we found a 7-Eleven! Because we were so early to the grounds we were able to eat our noodles and other assorted food items on the temple grounds without a whole bunch of people, which was refreshing after having been in crowded airports and airplanes the whole previous day.</p>

            </div>
            <p>After thoroughly enjoying the peaceful morning at Senso-ji, we took off on what turned out to be a longer than expected walk in the hotter than expected sun to the Tokyo Skytree. We were certain that by the time we got there it would be crowded with the tourists that had been absent at the temple. To our surprise, we were the only ones there. Seriously, the staff easily outnumbered the visitors which allowed us to spend all the time we wanted admiring the homage to Hello Kitty that had been set up on the top floor.</p>
            <p>At 2080 ft, the Skytree is Japan’s tallest building making it the 2nd tallest structure in the world, second only to the Burj Khalifa. The highest floor open to the public is the upper observation deck and floats 1400 feet above Tokyo. In a display of Japanese hospitality, there is a staff member waiting to greet you with a bow as you step off of the elevator onto the observation deck. Everyone we met during our trip had this same gracious and friendly attitude towards us, which was certainly welcome.</p>
            <p>On top of the Skytree you realize just how large a city Tokyo is. Looking at pictures it is hard to appreciate Tokyo’s size and it’s not until you sand on top of something as tall as the Skytree that you really get the feel for it. And I really do mean a feeling. Looking out over the city makes you feel like you are standing in a fishbowl. The city stretches out to what looks like infinity in all directions and makes you feel incredibly small. It’s very impressive and despite my best efforts, I couldn’t get a picture that captured it and simply chose to enjoy it while we were there.</p>

            </div>
            <p>At this point we were getting hungry again (I blame the overzealous sun) and set off in search of a place to eat. Conveniently, the subway had a station at the base of the Skytree and we were able to hop on using our convenient reloadable Suica pass cards and hop off again at Ueno station which is just across the street from Ameyoko market.</p>
            <p>Due to the relentles sun, we found a place with an awning on the street and ordered an egg wrap of sorts and a bowl of dumpling ramen. As was to be expected it was all super good and left us wanting more. After convincing ourselves that gorging ourselves wasn’t in our best interests, we took off for the subway again to make our way to Takeshita Street.</p>
            <p>Takeshita Street is the place to go if you like shopping. We aren’t shoppers. We visited because everyone says you should check it out and it definitely was interesting, but not really our thing. Takeshita Street is really just a street crowded with people buying things from a bunch of shops selling a hodgepodge of things. What made it worth the visit in the end was that Vista found an ice cream shop that sold the most over-the-top ice cream we’ve ever seen and immediately bought a cone. The shop, Cookie Time, had a statue of their possibly intoxicated mascot out front for Vista to pose with a for a picture.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Now, Tokyo (as well as the rest of Japan) isn’t like most large cities I’ve visited in that it is sparkling clean. After visiting New York City (and watching Buddy the elf eat gum off the street in Elf) I was under the impression that most, if not all, large cities would be dirty. Tokyo seems to have it figured out. There aren’t trash cans anywhere to be found, yet there isn’t any trash lying around either. Needless to say, we were very impressed.</p>
            <p>The down side of all of the cleanliness was that when we tried to take Vista’s newfound ice cream treasure into Yoyogi Park across the street from Takeshita Street, we were stopped by the police and asked to finish the ice cream before entering the park. In other words, you aren’t allowed to eat inside the park. I’m sure you can guess that this policy results in Yoyogi being spotless. And it was.</p>
            <p>At the entrance to Yoyogi park is a 40-50 foot tall torii gate which you walk through to enter the park. Once inside, if you follow the right path, you will find your way to a Shinto temple named Meji Jingu in the middle of the park. The walking path is completely enclosed by large trees which do a great job of taking you out of the city and into nature. Along the way you will find a wall of sake barrels each decorated in some way. These barrels are put on display to represent the donations of sake made by brewers to the temple each year that are used in the various rituals conducted temple. After walking for a short time, you’ll arrive at another large torii gate like the one at the entrance to the park that marks the entrance to the temple grounds. Inside is a small courtyard with a fountain to wash your hands before making an offering and saying a prayer at the temple before heading back out into the forest in the city.</p>

            <p>After enjoying the park, we re-entered the city and started the short walk over to the Shibuya Station. The real attraction here is the crosswalk outside the station known as Shibuya Crossing. This is said to be the busiest crosswalk in the world with upwards of 2,000 people crossing it at its busiest time of the day. Aside from this, it looks just like any other large crosswalk, except maybe that the crosswalk lines cutting diagonally through the center of the intersection are nearly 15 feet wide. Once there, we found a seat at the Starbuck’s on the second story of the Shibuya 101 building overlooking the intersection and watched the people down below while we rested.</p>

            <pHaving rested up a bit after a long day of walking we took off again for Akihabara. Akihabara is known for it’s high density of anime culture oriented shops and displays. The buildings are covered in large posters and neon signs advertising various anime products. The stores stock everything from video games to cosplay outfits. Unfortunately, despite hearing that there would be cosplayers out and about on the streets, everyone was dressed normally when we visited. Regardless, Akihabara was and interesting stop and was worth the quick visit to walk through the unique shops. We found several stores stuffed to the brim with figurines, playing cards, and arcade games which turned out to be interesting to look at even if we weren’t interested in buying anything.</p>

            </div>
            <p>At this point we were getting worn out from walking nearly 10 miles on hard concrete and decided to find a place to eat. I took us a minute to find a place among all of the shops, but we manged. After a quick bowl of ramen, we made our way back to Taito (the city where our Airbnb was) stopping at a grocery store on the way to grab some food for breakfast the next morning.</p>
