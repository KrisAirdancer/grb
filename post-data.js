        blurb: "Back in June was our wedding. As one would expect we took off on a honeymoon the next day. About a year before when we were planning the wedding and honeymoon, we stumbled upon some relatively cheap plane tickets to Narita airport outside Tokyo. We both thought a trip to Japan would be amazing, so we jumped at the opportunity and built our trip around the flights. We couldn’t have been happier with the outcome.",
